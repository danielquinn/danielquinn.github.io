# danielquinn.github.io

This is just my GitHub.io space.  I'm using submodules where appropriate, so if
you're interested in any of the components, it's probably best to visit those
pages directly.

For now though, you can visit the demos for
[gentoo-thanks](http://danielquinn.github.io/projects/gentoo-thanks/) and 
[bitcoin-donate](http://danielquinn.github.io/projects/bitcoin-donate/) if
you're curious.
